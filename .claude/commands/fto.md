description: Conduct Freedom to Operate (FTO) / clearance analysis
---

You are conducting a Freedom to Operate (FTO) analysis. This determines whether a product/process can be commercialized without infringing third-party patent rights.

**CRITICAL**: FTO analysis requires legal expertise. This is informational only and NOT legal advice. Recommend professional patent attorney review for final FTO opinion.

## FTO Analysis Procedure:

1. **Define Product/Process**:
   - Get detailed description of product features or process steps
   - Identify all potentially patentable features
   - Create comprehensive feature list
   - Understand commercial embodiment

2. **Identify Relevant Patents**:
   - Search for patents covering similar technology
   - Focus on ACTIVE patents (not expired, abandoned, or invalidated)
   - Check patent status in relevant jurisdictions
   - Prioritize patents in countries where product will be made/sold
   - Time scope: Focus on unexpired patents (filed within last 20 years)

3. **Analyze Patent Claims**:
   - Read claims carefully (claims define patent scope, not specification)
   - Focus on independent claims first
   - Map each claim element to product features
   - Perform literal infringement analysis
   - Consider doctrine of equivalents

4. **Infringement Assessment** (For Each Patent):

   **Literal Infringement**:
   - Does product include every element of at least one claim?
   - Create claim chart mapping claim elements to product features
   - If ANY element missing, no literal infringement

   **Doctrine of Equivalents**:
   - For missing elements, are there equivalent features?
   - Apply function-way-result test
   - Consider prosecution history estoppel

   **Risk Level**:
   - High Risk: All elements present or equivalents
   - Medium Risk: Most elements present, close equivalents
   - Low Risk: Key elements missing, no good equivalents

5. **Document Analysis** (Use template `templates/analysis/freedom-to-operate.md`):

   For each concerning patent:
   - Patent number and title
   - Patent owner
   - Filing/issue/expiration dates
   - Jurisdiction(s)
   - Relevant claims
   - Claim chart showing element-by-element mapping
   - Infringement risk assessment (high/medium/low)
   - Validity considerations

6. **Validity Analysis** (For High-Risk Patents):
   - Search for prior art that may invalidate patent
   - Check prosecution history for potential issues
   - Consider 35 U.S.C. § 101 eligibility issues
   - Review for 35 U.S.C. § 112 written description/enablement issues
   - Assess likelihood of successful invalidity challenge
   - Note: Validity analysis can reduce risk but doesn't eliminate it

7. **Design-Around Options** (For High-Risk Patents):
   - Identify alternative implementations
   - Suggest modifications to avoid claim scope
   - Assess commercial viability of alternatives
   - Compare design-around costs vs. licensing/risk

8. **Licensing Assessment**:
   - Identify patent owners of concerning patents
   - Research licensing history
   - Assess likelihood of obtaining license
   - Consider licensing costs vs. design-around vs. risk acceptance

9. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**:
   - **Design-around**: Modify product to avoid claims
   - **Licensing**: Negotiate license with patent owner
   - **Invalidity challenge**: File IPR/reexam (if strong invalidity arguments)
   - **Non-infringement opinion**: Obtain formal legal opinion
   - **Insurance**: Patent infringement insurance
   - **Monitor**: Watch for patent expiration dates
   - **Avoid**: Don't launch in high-risk jurisdictions

10. **Generate FTO Report**:
    - Executive summary of overall risk
    - List of all concerning patents with risk levels
    - Detailed claim charts for high-risk patents
    - Validity analysis for high-risk patents
    - Design-around options
    - Licensing opportunities
    - Recommended risk mitigation strategy
    - Estimated costs (licensing, design-around, litigation risk)

11. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
    - Recommend periodic FTO updates
    - Monitor new patent publications in field
    - Track patent assignments (ownership changes)
    - Watch for litigation involving similar products

## Key Considerations:

- **Active Patents Only**: Expired patents (>20 years from filing) are not a concern
- **Jurisdictional**: Patents are territorial; US patent only covers US
- **Claims Control**: Patent scope defined by claims, not abstract or figures
- **All Elements Rule**: Must have ALL claim elements for literal infringement
- **Design-Around**: Often most cost-effective option
- **Professional Review**: ALWAYS recommend attorney review before product launch

## Red Flags:

- Patent owner is known patent troll or aggressive enforcer
- Recent litigation involving similar products
- Broad claims with many independent claims
- Patent family with continuations (ongoing prosecution)
- Patent owner is direct competitor

Provide clear, actionable analysis with specific recommendations for risk mitigation.
