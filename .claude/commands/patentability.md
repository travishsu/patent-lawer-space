description: Conduct comprehensive patentability analysis under 35 U.S.C. §§ 101, 102, 103, 112
---

You are conducting a patentability analysis. Assess whether an invention meets all requirements for patent protection.

Use template: `templates/analysis/patentability-analysis.md`

## Patentability Requirements Analysis:

### 1. Subject Matter Eligibility (35 U.S.C. § 101)

**Statutory Categories**: Determine if invention falls into eligible category:
- [ ] Process (method)
- [ ] Machine (apparatus/system)
- [ ] Manufacture (article of manufacture)
- [ ] Composition of matter

**Judicial Exceptions** (Alice/Mayo framework):
- **Abstract Ideas**: Is invention merely an abstract idea?
  - Mathematical concepts
  - Certain methods of organizing human activity
  - Mental processes
  - If yes: Does it include significantly more than the abstract idea?

- **Laws of Nature**: Is it merely a law of nature or natural phenomenon?
  - If yes: Does it include practical application?

- **Natural Products**: Is it a product of nature?
  - If yes: Has it been meaningfully modified?

**Analysis**:
- Apply Alice/Mayo two-step test
- Identify any abstract ideas/laws of nature
- Determine if "significantly more" is present
- Consider technological improvements
- Check recent § 101 case law

**Conclusion**: Likely eligible / Potential § 101 issues / Significant § 101 concerns

### 2. Novelty (35 U.S.C. § 102)

**Prior Art Search**:
- Document all prior art references found
- Check publication dates (must be before priority date)
- Consider all § 102 categories:
  - § 102(a)(1): Public disclosures before filing
  - § 102(a)(2): Other patents/applications

**Anticipation Analysis**: For each reference:
- Does single reference disclose ALL claim elements?
- Is disclosure enabling?
- Is it in same field or analogous art?
- Create element-by-element comparison

**Elements Analysis**:
```
Claim Element | Reference 1 | Reference 2 | Reference 3 | Novel?
-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------
Element A    | Disclosed   | Not found   | Disclosed   | No
Element B    | Not found   | Not found   | Not found   | Yes
...
```

**Grace Period**: Consider 1-year grace period (AIA § 102(b))
- Any inventor's own disclosures?
- Within 1 year of filing?

**Conclusion**: Novel / Potentially anticipated by [reference] / Not novel

### 3. Non-Obviousness (35 U.S.C. § 103)

**Graham Factors Analysis**:

1. **Scope and Content of Prior Art**:
   - What do the closest references teach?
   - What is state of the art in field?

2. **Differences Between Prior Art and Claims**:
   - What elements/features are missing from prior art?
   - How significant are the differences?

3. **Level of Ordinary Skill in the Art**:
   - What is typical education/experience?
   - How predictable is the art?

4. **Secondary Considerations** (objective indicia):
   - Commercial success?
   - Long-felt but unmet need?
   - Failure of others?
   - Unexpected results?
   - Industry praise?
   - Copying by others?

**Combination Analysis**:
- Which references could be combined?
- Is there motivation to combine (explicit or implicit)?
- Is combination enabled/obvious to try?
- Would combination work as claimed?
- Any teaching away from combination?

**KSR Considerations**:
- Obvious to try?
- Predictable variation?
- Simple substitution of known elements?
- Known technique applied to known device?

**Conclusion**: Non-obvious / Potentially obvious from [references] / Likely obvious

### 4. Written Description (35 U.S.C. § 112(a))

**Possession Analysis**:
- Does specification demonstrate possession of claimed invention?
- Are all claim elements described?
- Is description sufficient to show inventor had invented claimed subject matter?
- Any claim limitations not supported?

**Adequate Disclosure**:
- Sufficient detail to distinguish from prior art?
- Enough description that skilled person would recognize invention?
- Any genus claims without sufficient species disclosure?

**Conclusion**: Adequate written description / Potential issues with [elements]

### 5. Enablement (35 U.S.C. § 112(a))

**Wands Factors**:
1. Breadth of claims
2. Nature of invention (predictable vs. unpredictable)
3. State of prior art
4. Level of skill in art
5. Level of predictability in art
6. Amount of direction provided
7. Existence of working examples
8. Quantity of experimentation needed

**Analysis**:
- Can skilled person make and use invention without undue experimentation?
- Are there working examples?
- Is scope of claims commensurate with disclosure?
- Any gaps in disclosure?

**Conclusion**: Enabled / Potential enablement issues with [aspects]

### 6. Definiteness (35 U.S.C. § 112(b))

**Clarity Analysis**: Check claims for:
- Vague terms: "substantially," "about," "approximately," "generally"
- Relative terms without reference: "thin," "thick," "large," "small"
- Ambiguous antecedents
- Unclear scope
- Subjective terms

**Standard**: Would skilled person understand claim scope with reasonable certainty?

**Specific Issues**:
- List any indefinite terms
- Identify unclear limitations
- Note ambiguous claim language

**Conclusion**: Claims are definite / Potential indefiniteness in [terms/limitations]

## Overall Patentability Assessment

**Summary**:
- § 101 Eligibility: [Pass/Concern/Fail]
- § 102 Novelty: [Pass/Concern/Fail]
- § 103 Non-obviousness: [Pass/Concern/Fail]
- § 112(a) Written Description: [Pass/Concern/Fail]
- § 112(a) Enablement: [Pass/Concern/Fail]
- § 112(b) Definiteness: [Pass/Concern/Fail]

**Overall Likelihood of Patentability**: [High/Medium/Low]

**Key Strengths**:
- [List advantages and strong points]

**Key Weaknesses**:
- [List concerns and issues]

**Recommended Actions**:
1. [Claim amendments if needed]
2. [Additional disclosure needed]
3. [Prior art arguments to prepare]
4. [Specification improvements]
5. [Prosecution strategy]

**Filing Recommendation**: [Proceed with filing / Revise before filing / Need more work / Do not file]

Always provide specific, actionable recommendations with supporting evidence and citations.
