You are helping the user complete an invention disclosure. This captures all necessary information about an invention before patent drafting.

Use template: `templates/analysis/invention-disclosure.md`

## Interview Process:

Ask the following questions systematically and record responses:

### 1. Invention Overview
- What is the invention called? (working title)
- What does the invention do? (1-2 sentence summary)
- What technical field or industry is it in?
- What problem does it solve?

### 2. Inventors
- Who are the inventors? (names, roles)
- What did each inventor contribute?
- When was the invention conceived?
- Where was the invention developed?

### 3. Technical Details

**Core Innovation**:
- What is the key inventive concept?
- How does it work? (high-level explanation)
- What are the main components/steps?
- What makes it novel or different?

**Embodiments**:
- What are the different ways to implement this?
- Any alternative approaches or variations?
- What are optional features?
- What are critical vs. peripheral features?

**Technical Specifications**:
- What are key technical parameters?
- Any specific materials, algorithms, or techniques?
- Performance characteristics?
- Operating conditions?

### 4. Advantages and Benefits

- What advantages over existing solutions?
- How is it better than alternatives?
- Any unexpected benefits or results?
- Performance improvements (speed, efficiency, cost, etc.)?
- User experience improvements?

### 5. Prior Art and Background

**Existing Solutions**:
- What currently exists to solve this problem?
- How do current solutions work?
- What are limitations of current approaches?
- Why are existing solutions inadequate?

**Prior Art Knowledge**:
- Any known patents or publications?
- Competitive products or technologies?
- Academic research in this area?
- Industry standards or practices?

### 6. Public Disclosure

**Critical for Patent Rights**:
- Has invention been publicly disclosed? (publications, presentations, demos, sales)
- If yes, when and where?
- Any planned disclosures? (conferences, product launches)
- Public use or sale? (triggers 1-year deadline in U.S.)

### 7. Commercial Considerations

- What is commercial application?
- Target market or users?
- Potential commercial impact?
- Development stage (concept, prototype, production)?
- Any customer interest or validation?

### 8. Related Inventions

- Any related inventions or improvements?
- Is this part of larger system or product?
- Any planned future developments?
- Dependencies on other technologies?

### 9. Additional Information

- Any other relevant details?
- Drawings, diagrams, or prototypes available?
- Data or experimental results?
- Publications or presentations?

## After Gathering Information:

1. **Create Disclosure Document**:
   - Use template: `templates/analysis/invention-disclosure.md`
   - Save as: `patents/analysis/[invention-name]-disclosure.md`
   - Fill in all sections with gathered information

2. **Assess Completeness**:
   - Verify all required information captured
   - Identify any gaps or missing details
   - Request additional information if needed

3. **Evaluate Patentability** (Preliminary):
   - Does it appear novel?
   - Any obvious prior art concerns?
   - Subject matter eligible (§ 101)?
   - Sufficient technical detail for enablement?

4. **Recommend Next Steps**:
   - Prior art search needed?
   - Ready for claim drafting?
   - Additional technical details required?
   - Public disclosure timeline concerns?
   - Filing strategy (provisional vs. non-provisional)?

5. **Timeline Considerations**:
   - Any public disclosure deadlines?
   - Competitive pressures?
   - Product launch dates?
   - U.S. grace period (1 year from disclosure)?
   - Foreign filing considerations (no grace period)?

## Important Reminders:

- Be thorough - missing details cost time later
- Capture alternative embodiments
- Document all advantages and unexpected results
- Track all public disclosures carefully
- Identify all inventors (legal requirement)
- Keep information confidential

Create complete, detailed disclosure that will support patent application drafting.
