description: Identify relevant CPC/IPC patent classifications for invention
---

You are identifying relevant patent classifications for an invention.

## Classification Systems:

**CPC** (Cooperative Patent Classification): Used by USPTO and EPO
**IPC** (International Patent Classification): Used internationally

## Process:

### 1. Understand the Invention

- Read invention description
- Identify main technical field
- Identify key technical features
- Determine primary function/purpose
- Note any cross-disciplinary aspects

### 2. Identify Primary Technical Field

Common CPC sections:
- **A**: Human Necessities (agriculture, health, life-saving)
- **B**: Performing Operations; Transporting
- **C**: Chemistry; Metallurgy
- **D**: Textiles; Paper
- **E**: Fixed Constructions (building, mining)
- **F**: Mechanical Engineering; Lighting; Heating; Weapons
- **G**: Physics (instruments, computing, optics, communications)
- **H**: Electricity (semiconductors, electric circuits, antennas)
- **Y**: General tagging (cross-sectional technologies)

### 3. Drill Down to Specific Classifications

**Classification Hierarchy**:
```
Section → Class → Subclass → Group → Subgroup
G      → 06    → F        → 3     → 01
```

Example: G06F 3/01
- G: Physics
- G06: Computing; Calculating
- G06F: Electric Digital Data Processing
- G06F 3: Input arrangements for transferring data
- G06F 3/01: Input arrangements (general)

### 4. Search Classification Database

Use CPC browser: https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/

**Search Methods**:
1. **Keyword Search**: Search for technical terms
2. **Browse Hierarchy**: Navigate classification tree
3. **Example Patents**: Look at similar patents' classifications

### 5. Identify Multiple Classifications

**Primary Classification**: Main technical field (most relevant)

**Secondary Classifications**: Additional relevant areas
- Related technologies
- Alternative uses
- Cross-sectional applications

Most inventions have 3-7 relevant classifications.

### 6. Common Technology Areas

**Software/Computing** (G section):
- G06F 3/: Input/output arrangements
- G06F 9/: Program control arrangements
- G06F 16/: Information retrieval; databases
- G06F 17/: Digital computing for specific functions
- G06F 21/: Security arrangements
- G06N 3/: Neural networks; machine learning
- G06N 20/: Machine learning
- G06Q: Data processing for business/administrative/financial purposes

**Networking/Communications** (H section):
- H04L 9/: Cryptography
- H04L 29/: Network arrangements/protocols
- H04L 67/: Network services
- H04W: Wireless communication networks

**User Interfaces**:
- G06F 3/048: Interaction with graphical user interfaces

**Medical/Health** (A section):
- A61B 5/: Detecting/measuring for diagnostic purposes
- A61K: Pharmaceutical preparations
- A61M: Devices for introducing media into body

**Electronics** (H section):
- H01L: Semiconductor devices
- H02J: Power systems
- H03K: Pulse circuits

### 7. Generate Classification Report

Provide:

**Primary Classification**: [CPC code] - [Description]
**Rationale**: Why this is most relevant

**Secondary Classifications**:
1. [CPC code] - [Description] - [Relevance]
2. [CPC code] - [Description] - [Relevance]
3. [CPC code] - [Description] - [Relevance]

**IPC Equivalents**: [Corresponding IPC codes]

**Search Recommendations**:
- Start with primary classification
- Expand to secondary classifications
- Use classification in patent database searches
- Combine with keyword searches

**Related Classifications to Monitor**:
- [Nearby/related classifications for monitoring new patents]

### 8. Use in Prior Art Search

**Search Strategy**:
```
CPC=[primary code] OR CPC=[secondary code]
AND ([keywords])
```

**Database-Specific Syntax**:
- USPTO: Use "CPC/" prefix
- Google Patents: Use "CPC" field
- Espacenet: Use "CPC" search

### 9. Verification

**Check**:
- Review sample patents in each classification
- Verify they're similar to invention
- Ensure classifications cover all aspects
- Not too broad or too narrow

**Adjust**:
- Add missed classifications
- Remove irrelevant ones
- Refine to more specific subgroups if available

Provide specific, actionable classification recommendations for effective prior art searching.
