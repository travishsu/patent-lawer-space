## Example Abstract

A method and system for automated patent prior art searching using natural language processing and machine learning. Traditional patent searches require extensive manual effort and specialized expertise. The disclosed system employs a neural network trained on patent corpus data to analyze invention disclosures, extract key technical features, generate optimized search queries, and rank prior art references by relevance. The system includes a disclosure analyzer, a semantic search engine, and a results ranking module that considers both textual similarity and technical domain relationships. The method significantly reduces search time while improving comprehensiveness and accuracy of prior art identification.
