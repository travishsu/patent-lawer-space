## SEMICONDUCTOR-SPECIFIC CLAIM DRAFTING GUIDELINES

### Structure Claim Best Practices

1. **Layer-by-Layer Description**: Describe structures from bottom to top or inside to out
2. **Material Specification**: Include specific materials or material classes
3. **Dimensional Ranges**: Use ranges rather than exact values (allows manufacturing tolerance)
4. **Doping Details**: Specify doping type (n-type, p-type) and concentration ranges
5. **Functional Language**: Use "configured to" or "adapted to" for functional limitations
6. **Interface Relationships**: Clearly describe how layers relate (on, in, adjacent to, contacting)

### Process Claim Best Practices

1. **Sequential Steps**: List steps in chronological order
2. **Process Parameters**: Include temperature, pressure, time ranges where novel
3. **Material Precursors**: Specify precursors for deposition/growth processes
4. **Conditions**: State ambient, atmosphere, gas flow rates if critical
5. **Avoid Product-by-Process**: Unless structure is novel, focus on process innovation

   - "adjacent to" (next to, but may not contact)
   - "contacting" (direct physical contact)

4. **Include Ranges Appropriately:**
   - Use "in a range of X to Y" or "between X and Y"

   - Ranges should cover working embodiments and allow manufacturing tolerance

5. **Avoid Overclaiming:**
