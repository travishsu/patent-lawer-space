## CLAIMS

### Independent Claims

**Claim 1.** [Broadest independent claim - system/apparatus claim]
A [system/apparatus/device] comprising:
- a [first element] configured to [function];
- a [second element] operably connected to the [first element], wherein the [second element] is configured to [function];
- a [third element] configured to [function]; and
- wherein [overall system relationship/function].

**Claim 2.** [Method claim corresponding to Claim 1]
A method comprising:
- [first step];
- [second step];
- [third step]; and
- [fourth step].

**Claim 3.** [Computer-readable medium claim, if applicable]
A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to:
- [first function];
- [second function]; and
- [third function].

### Dependent Claims

**Claim 4.** The [system/apparatus/device] of claim 1, wherein the [element] further comprises [additional limitation].

**Claim 5.** The [system/apparatus/device] of claim 1, wherein the [element] is configured to [additional function].

**Claim 6.** The [system/apparatus/device] of claim 1, wherein [specific implementation detail].

**Claim 7.** The method of claim 2, further comprising [additional step].

**Claim 8.** The method of claim 2, wherein [step] comprises:
- [sub-step 1]; and
- [sub-step 2].

**Claim 9.** The method of claim 2, wherein [specific parameter or condition].

**Claim 10.** The [system/apparatus/device] of claim 4, wherein [further limitation building on claim 4].

## CLAIMS DRAFTING GUIDELINES

### Best Practices
1. **Independent Claims:** Start broad, cover core inventive concept
2. **Dependent Claims:** Add specific implementations, alternatives, and improvements
3. **Claim Differentiation:** Each claim should add value and patentability
4. **Language:** Use clear, precise, consistent terminology
5. **Antecedent Basis:** Ensure proper use of "a/an" (first mention) and "the" (subsequent)

### Typical Claim Structure
- **Preamble:** Introduces the category (system, method, apparatus, etc.)
- **Transition:** "comprising" (open-ended), "consisting of" (closed), "consisting essentially of" (middle ground)
- **Body:** Elements and their relationships

### Common Claim Types
- **Apparatus/System Claims:** Physical structures and components
- **Method Claims:** Steps and processes
- **Computer-Readable Medium Claims:** Software inventions
- **Means-Plus-Function Claims:** Functional limitations (use cautiously)
